# crash_course_R

There are quite a few "crash courses", tutorials and full courses in R programming language. 
This is my own flavour: 
the course is intended for students that are currently using spreadsheets (such as Open Office Calc, Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets). it is divided in 4 lessons
1) basic concepts in data management (data types, named variables, formulas, print, read and write csv, versioning and comments). These basic tasks can be easily carried out also with a spreadsheet, which is a good point to start if you already have some practice. then we will reproduce the same solution in R. We'll use a cloud version to focus only on the code (no installation and configuration).   
2) flow controls: if/else and a few things spreadheets can't do: for loops, and dataframes. At this stage we will use some R libraries and learn how to install R on your computer
3) ...
4) ... 

This GitLab repository contains the example and the scripts.
